<!--The scientific method of inquiry leads us to an understanding of the universe as being composed of mostly dark energy and dark matter. Humblingly, we do not have an existing physical framework to explain their properties. -->
The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at the Brookhaven National Laboratory have the ability to collide heavy nuclei, such as those of gold and uranium, at nearly the speed of light, reaching temperatures of trillions of degrees Celcius. These laboratories have provided evidence of the formation of an exotic state of matter, called the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). It only exists for a brief amount of time after such collisions and instantly freezes out into a plethora of new particles, which carry the signatures we can use to deduct QGP properties. It reportedly behaves like an almost perfect quantum fluid with no resistance and exhibits other interesting properties.
</p>
<p>
One of the methods to probe the properties of this matter is by analyzing the conversion of the beam-direction energy at the time of collision into transverse energy after the collision. This analysis is generally done by using data from the calorimeters placed around the collision site. Under Dr. Christine Nattrass in the Relativistic Heavy Ion Physics (RHIP) group at the University of Tennessee (UT), I am developing C++ codes for a new method to perform the transverse energy analysis by using tracking detectors instead of the conventional calorimeters.
</p>
<p>
This method involves a manipulation of the transverse momentum spectra, utilizing the mathematical tools pertaining to heavy-ion collision physics, to calculate the transverse energy production. Due to the limited capabilities of the detectors, however, there is a lack of available data points corresponding to low and high momenta. I use the Boltzmann-Gibbs blast wave function to perform a non-linear regression on the available data points and extract the good-fit parameters and other statistics to extrapolate the given spectrum into the low- and high- momentum regions. CERN's ROOT, an object-oriented framework for large-scale data analysis, comes handy in this regard.
</p>
<p>
Before joining the RHIP group, I worked under Dr. Alfredo Galindo-Uribarri at the Physics Division in Oak Ridge National Laboratory in projects related to the study of the decay of the uranium nucleus through the resulting (anti)neutrino signal. About a trillion neutrinos pass through our bodies every second, unnoticed. They are so difficult to detect because they only interact by the nuclear weak force and the even weaker gravity. Very sensitive detectors have to be built to detect them, and clever algorithms and statistical approaches have to be devised to study the noisy signals. I did a literature review of the performance of scintilaltion materials at low temperatures and presented it in a seminar at UT. I also attended a data analysis workshop at Yale Wright Laboratory and assisted in the assembly of the liquid scintillator detector system for the PROSPECT collaboration.

Under Dr. Thomas Pannuti at the Astrophysics Resarch Laboratory in Morehead State University, I studied supernova remnants and nearby galaxies using archival data from the <i> Chandra </i> X-ray Observatory. I used the standard protocol developed for <i> Chandra </i> data analysis to apply different calibrations to the raw data, subtract backgrounds from the observed X-ray sources, and perform spatially-resolved spectral analysis to determine the chemical composition and the nature of the physical processes responsible for the emitted radiation. I discovered sources of X-ray in nearby galaxies, and by analyzing the observations of the same locations in the sky at different periods of time as well as by telescopes sensitive to different frequencies of light (X-ray, infrared, radio), I classified the sources into categories such as binary stars, supernova remnants, background galaxies and background galaxy clusters.
</p>

<p>
In the summer of 2013, I received the DAAD-RISE (German Academic Exchange Service – Research Internships in Science and Engineering) scholarship to work with the <i> Dark Energy Team </i> at the Argelander-Institut für Astronomie in Bonn, Germany. We studied the dynamical disturbance in the cores of galaxy clusters by measuring the offset between the X-ray emission center and the location of the Brightest Cluster Galaxy or the weak lensing center. Measurement of the offsets is useful in validating the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium used in, for instance, the estimation of the cluster mass.

Detection of these sources involved using a tool called 'wavdetect' from the <i> Chandra </i> analysis library. It implements a Mexican Hat wavelet-based source detection algorithm that estimates a local background around a putative source, checks to see if the signal being seen in the pixel is significantly higher than expected, and iteratively tests a hypothesis that the observed signal can be obtained as a fluctuation from the background.">

I contributed in the preliminary calibration of the payload on board the cubesat Cosmic X-ray Background Nanosatellite - 2 (CXBN-2) that was deployed on 16 May 2017 from the International Space Station. I used beta decay signals from radioisotopes to test the performance of the off-the-shelf X-ray detector, a Cadmium-Zinc-Telluride semiconductor array, at several different energies relevant to the science mission's goal of studying the cosmic X-ray background at the 30-50 keV range. Based on the amount of radiation the spacecraft would receive in space, I helped the principle investigator, Dr. Ben Malphrus at Morehead State University (MSU), make choice of the orbit, and by estimating the rate of the data that would be collected by the detector arrays, I helped the ground operations team make decisions about the methods and the frequency of data downlink. I represented the science mission during the Preliminary Design Review of the project with NASA and external reviewers and demonstrated compliance of the science mission objectives and operations with the spacecraft systems constraints.

From August 6-11, 2014, Bob Kroll and I used the 21 meter Space Tracking Antenna (STA) at Morehead State University to exchange telemetry between NASA's abandoned ISEE-3 spacecraft and the unofficial and crowdfunded ISEE-3 Reboot project. The <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cometary_Explorer'> ISEE-3 Wikipedia page </a> has more details about the reboot effort.
